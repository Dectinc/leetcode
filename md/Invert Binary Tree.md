## [Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/)

### Problem

Invert a binary tree.
```
     4
   /   \
  2     7
 / \   / \
1   3 6   9
```
to
```
     4
   /   \
  7     2
 / \   / \
9   6 3   1
```

__Trivia__:

This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:
```
Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off.
```

### Solution


### Code

``` Python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    # @param {TreeNode} root
    # @return {TreeNode}
    def invertTree(self, root):
        if root is None:
            return root
        tmp = root.left
        root.left = self.invertTree(root.right)
        root.right = self.invertTree(tmp)
        return root
```
